# philosophers
In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes. And in the bonus part you will work with processes and semaphores.

## Overview
- the execution :
  ```bash
  <!-- Mandatory part -->
  cd philo
  <!-- Bonus part -->
  cd philo_bonus

  make

  ./philo n_philo T_to_die T_to_eat T_to_sleep max_meals_each_philosopher_must_eat

  ``````
- The program will simulate life of n_philosopher , each philosopher will take T_to_eat ms (millisecond) to eat and  T_to_sleep ms to sleep but if the one of them exceeds T_to_die ms between two meals the simulation will be end by death of this philo , else the simulation will goes.
- The last param max_meals_each_philosopher_must_eat is optional. when all philos eats max_meals_each_philosopher_must_eat time the simulation ends.
- Each philosopher is a thread.
- Each fork is a mutex.
- Every philosopher needs two forks to eat, but he has one, so he uses his friendâ€™s fork, and here the data race occurs. So the data race problem should be resolved.
- In the bonus part each philosopher is a process and all the forks are a semaphore.
